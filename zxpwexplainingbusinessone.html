                    <p>Welcome to the first instalment of the “Explaining Business” series. Each article in this series will explain a few concepts using different, off-the-beaten-track examples each time. I’ll try to keep it as short and effective as possible, with links to relevant articles wherever possible. Today’s key terms: <b>Business Model; Marketing; Positioning; Targeting; Venture Capital.</b></p>
                    <p>So why does the title read ‘business’ and then that band you love?<br/>It’s simple. The reason for that is, over the last decade, the music industry has become a game of marketing and promoting artists more than the music itself. Management companies representing artists go the very ends of the earth to make sure their people are the ones making the biggest ripples throughout the world. But all of the glitz and the glamour doesn’t last more than a few albums at best, because there is always the “up and coming new guy” to take the position that the artist in question was holding before. Think carefully, and you’ll notice a striking similarity of the music industry with the white-collar corporate world.</p>
                    <p>If you look at music as a ‘product’ and its artist as the ‘brand’ responsible for said product, it makes sense to call the audience the ‘market’. Following on these lines, it would make the newcomers ‘substitute products’ and pre-existing artists the ‘competition’.</p>
                    <p>Either way, an artist in the music business today burns brightly for a while and then fades away into oblivion. As the spotlight dims on them, so do their assets and their income, and quite shockingly, from reaching to the stars, it becomes a struggle to stay in the business.</p>
                    <p>I chose Linkin Park as my case in point for a very specific reason. Not only were they one of the greatest bands to grace the 21st century, they were very unique in their approach to the business. Unlike countless other predecessors and contemporaries, they identified the catch in the music business before they even started touring the world. In the late 90s, the members realised the importance of the technology that was going to hit the globe in the coming years, and they would not only need a ground breaking new approach, but also a back-up plan once their time was over. This strategy would have to make full use of the ever-growing online fan base and utilise fans’ growing responsiveness through the internet.</p>
                    <p>Long before Facebook and Twitter had taken over the internet, its communities were confined to online chat rooms and forums. Linkin Park developed a business model which focussed on marketing strategy of <b>targeting and positioning</b>, by surveying the audience and collecting their responses. Too many big words? I’ll dissect each of them shortly.</p>
                    <p>The band started out with the study and survey of their audience: their tastes grouped by region, the average duration of the tracks popular in that region and so on. With the help of this relentless information collection procedure, they knew where to strike their darts. The band had identified listener groups across the world and would proceed to organise hugely successful promotional campaigns in those regions.<br/>What Linkin Park did is very aptly called ‘market research’: the process of identification, in short. By knowing who their audience was, they also confirmed where their music sales would be highest. In short, they were now ‘targeted’ at those groups. Finally, their strategy ‘positioned’ themselves to make the most of that hype. The positioning ended with coming up with music to suit the tastes of the targeted groups, while staying true their own style.</p>
                    <p>But the story has one last chapter left, and personally, this was the bit that impressed me the most.<br/>As the first decade of the 21st century ended, Linkin Park had inevitably started to fade. New artists were coming in with a fresh approach to music, and their fan base had shifted to greener pastures. That is just how the world works.</p>
                    <p>In the words of Fortune.com,</p>
                    <blockquote>Linkin Park as a band is less relevant now, so Linkin Park, as a business, needs to try new things. Hence: produce cool videos; sell more schwag; and invest in startups.</blockquote>
                    <p>The factor that allowed them this flexibility was that their previous business model had been very well thought out. So what exactly is a business model?<br/>A business model is to a company or a brand, what an algorithm is to a computer programmer. It is a blueprint of the strategies and values that a company relies on for its profits.</p>
                    <p>Linkin Park has now started a Venture Capital firm, or VC to keep their profits going in spite of their fall from the top spot in the music business.<br/>The best way to understand what venture capitalists are is by going about it literally. Firms which provide capital for various ventures, are venture capital firms. If you’ve been reading a little about the recent affairs of Housing.com or Flipkart, or any other start-up company, this term is bound to come up. Venture capitalists fund such start-up companies who don’t otherwise have access to funding, in the hope of gaining a huge return if they turn out to be successful. A pretty big gamble, if you ask me.</p>
                    <p>Linkin Park’s huge brand appeal that they managed to build up over the years and their sheer size led them down this road. They have invested in startups like the investing app <b>Robinhood</b>, ride-sharing service <b>Lyft</b>, and ultra-hip coffee brewer <b>Blue Bottle</b>, and are still generating cash from these ventures.</p>
                    <p>In spite, of not being the most popular group of musicians currently, Linkin Park have turned an ending musical journey into a financial cash cow and are still managing to generate profits. In the end, that’s what business is all about.</p>
