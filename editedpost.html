                    <p>Housing.com has been in the news for all the wrong reasons in the past few weeks. First, it was the tersely worded resignation letter by CEO Rahul Yadav that was insulting to the board; this was followed by a quick retraction by him the same day. Then the various tiffs with other startup community members, from Alok Kejriwal to Deepinder Goyal of Zomato and Bhavish Aggarwal of Ola Cabs. This was soon followed by Rahul’s announcement in a company town hall that he would soon be transferring his 4.57% stake in the company to the employees, to the horror of the investors involved. And finally, the Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything) by Rahul where he spoke candidly about everything from investors (Sequoia in particular), Indian startups and co-founders. Rahul is either an extremely self-assured, shrewd individual who knows what he is doing in terms of rallying his troops, or he’s just brash and filled with the arrogance that only the naiveté of untested youth can breed. Either way, we, as outsiders have little access to facts in order to make valuable comment.</p>

                    <p>But one of the things that was widely written about in the media as the root cause for the difference of opinion between the management team and the board was the following: the INR 120 crore (estimated) online and offline #lookup marketing blitzkrieg that the company indulged in. Media reports spoke about how the board thought it was extravagant and how Rahul & team thought of it as necessary. Keeping aside all of the baggage of the drama that resulted, let us analyze the campaigns rationally and logically. The campaign utilized the following media:</p>

                    <p>- Print: National & Regional newspapers (with the lion’s share going to Times of India, until the defamation case by its parent against Rahul Yadav)<br>
					- Out of home: Billboards & Hoardings in 7 cities across India<br>
					- Digital: Social media such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter</p>

                    <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>

                    <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

                    <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

                    <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

                    <blockquote>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

                    <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

                    <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

                    <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>

                    <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

                    <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
